### What is this?
Just a sample of small barely functional examples for Google's text-to-speech
API. Sometimes I've noticed that I'm really not good at 'reverse spelling'
(transcribing a word when someone spells out a word or last name). This is just
a super quick reference that I put together from google's API docs to train this
(and just an excuse to play a bit with Google's text-to-speech API) From:
